272
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,840
And get me to take my pills

273
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,980
Don't worry, Mr. Ramirez, I'm trained for this kind of thing

274
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm going to take good care of you

275
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Hmm, well...

276
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,840
Sometimes you're going to have to calm me down

277
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:21,393
- I've got some really good drugs for that

278
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,240
That's all good and well, but that isn't exactly what I had in mind

Not everything's broke, you know

283
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,620
Look, Mr. Ramirez, let's just keep this professional, Ok?

284
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,240
You and I both know why they sent you to this job

285
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,140
What, I need to earn my keep?

286
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
It's none of your business

287

Let's get this straight

288
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,860
I'm your nurse, not your whore.

289
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
What's this then?

290
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,060
You were a prison bitch, now you're my bitch

That's none of your business!

You need to be on your best behavior or else.

Just one call about mistreating this old man, and you're out of a job, Honey.

Won't that revoke your parole?

What?

298
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,640
I know I shouldn't be bothering you at work

299
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:12,353

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
It's been a rough day

316
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,780
That last performance really took a lot out of her

317
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,700
Obviously, you girls need to talk

318
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,800
But could you at least give us a minute to get cleaned up

319
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,440
And then you can get to business?

320
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,900
Wow.

321
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,640
What the fuck?

322
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,060
Can I get one of those?

323
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
It's ok.

I'll be there in a minute

326

What do you want from me?

327
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,300
Alright, ladies, I'm going to show you how this is done

Yeah, my order is broken

I'm not really happy with it

Yeah, could you have your representative meet me outside?

334

Let's say 20 minutes?

Yeah, I know where that is

336
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,340
I can do that

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,220
You tell me now or I kill you!

508
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Tell me!

509
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:19,642
Fageeda Cunt!

510
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:22,764
What the fuck kind of name is Fageeda Cunt?!

511
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,056
I don't know!

512
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,360
It doesn't matter, ok?

513
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,340
We need to get out of here. Go!

514
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Fuck

515
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,440

(gun cocks)

517
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:49,637
So, how do we find stripper whore anyway?

518
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
¿yo qué sé?

519
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,900
It's not like they're in the phonebook

520
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,100
What do you want to do, go back to the strip club?

521
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,910
- Too dangerous

522
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,440
Excuse me, sir, my fellows and I were at your establishment recently

523
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,720
and we believe one of your employees may have killed our friend

524
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,990
Can you help us out?

525
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,520
(scoffs) I'd be happy to

526
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,780
Besides, it's too dangerous

527
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,640
I owe Candy 50 dollars still

528

Good job

529
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,800

Hey, it's me

534

Who are you calling, your mother?

535
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,720
Is she stripper whore too?

536
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,248
Come on, think about it

537

538

Suck it

539
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,820
No, we've got a bit of a problem with that last job

540
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:40,922
No, like a really big fucking problem

541

No, like a really big fucking problem

Like 2 of my friends dead kind of problem!

Look, you're a stripper.

That's not walking away from community pussy. That's not even a vacation

You want to know what the difference is?

583

Make them think that I'm in love with them

586

They give me money. They buy me nice things

587
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,500
Only difference is, I don't have to fuck them

588
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,880
Or I don't get my ass beat because one of them is in bad mood or some shit

What was up with that fucked up shit you were doing?

600

It's like you said

We give people what they want

602

They want pain. They want sex. They want violence

603

I give people what they crave

604

But you had paint covered on some naked dude

605
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,300
It's the same rhythm and motion

606
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,200
I'd rather put on a show than take part in the madness of reality

607
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,780
If it wasn't for Lexxi, I'd tell you all to go fuck yourseves
